[![Travis build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/junit-pioneer/junit-pioneer)
[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ijrlfaa2fpnxwm3r?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nicolaiparlog/junit-pioneer)

A melting pot for all kinds of extensions to
[JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5), particular to its Jupiter API.

## A Pioneer's Mission

JUnit Pioneer provides extensions for [JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/) and its Jupiter API.
It does not limit itself to proven ideas with wide application but is purposely open to experiments.
It aims to spin off successful and cohesive portions into sibling projects or back into the JUnit 5 code base.

To enable easy exchange of code with JUnit 5, JUnit Pioneer copies most of its infrastructure, from code style to build tool and configuration to continuous integration.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions of all kinds and shapes!
We are still building up infrastructure and what exactly we need help on is not easy to say, but we already settled on [what we want contributions to look like](CONTRIBUTING.md).
