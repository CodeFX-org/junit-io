:page-title: Disable Parameterized Test Based on Parameter Values
:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@DisableIfParameter`, which selectively disables parameterized tests

The `@DisableIfParameter` annotation can be used to selectively disable parameterized tests based on their parameter values (converted with `toString()`).
The annotation is only supported on test method level for parameterized tests.
Unlike the `@Disabled` API provided in JUnit Jupiter, which disables the test on first encounter of the annotation , `@DisableIfParameter` is validated before each parameterized test execution.
As a consequence, instead of disabling the entire set of parameterized tests, each test can be evaluated and possibly disabled individually.

[source,java]
----
// disable invocations whose parameter contains "she"
@DisableIfParameter(contains = "she")
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(strings = {
        "Tread lightly, she is near",
        "Under the snow,",
        "Speak gently, she can hear",
        "The daisies grow."
})
void interceptContains(String line) {
}
----

The test `interceptContains` ordinarily would run four times, but because the first and third lines contain the word "she", those invocations get disabled.

You can specify more than one substring at a time:

[source,java]
----
@DisableIfParameter(contains = { "bright", "dust" })
@ParameterizedTest
@CsvSource(delimiter = ';', value = {
        "All her bright golden hair;Tarnished with rust,",
        "She that was young and fair;Fallen to dust."
})
void interceptContainsAny(String line, String line2) {
}
----

`DisableIfParameter` will disable the test invocation if any parameter value matches any value from `contains`.
In this case, the test `interceptContainsAny` should have run two times, but both invocations got disabled.
The first invocation because the first parameter contains "bright".
The second invocation because the second parameter contains "dust".

If substrings are not powerful enough, you can also use regular expressions:

[source,java]
----
// disable invocations whose parameter ends with 'knew' or 'grew'
@DisableIfParameter(matches = { ".*knew", ".*grew" })
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(strings = {
        "Lily-like, white as snow,",
        "She hardly knew",
        "She was a woman, so",
        "Sweetly she grew"
})
void interceptMatches(String value) {
}
----

The second invocation has a parameter that ends with "knew", so it gets disabled.
The fourth invocation has a parameter that ends with "grew", so it gets disabled.

Just like with `contains`, if any parameter value matches any expression from `matches`, the invocation gets disabled.

You can use both, in which case a test is disabled if any parameter value contains a substring _or_ matches an expression:

[source,java]
----
@ParameterizedTest
@DisableIfParameter(
        contains = { "sonnet", "life" },
        matches = "^.*(.+)\\1.*$")
@ValueSource(strings = {
        "Peace, Peace, she cannot hear",
        "Lyre or sonnet,",
        "All my lifeâ€™s buried here,",
        "Heap earth upon it."
})
void interceptBoth(String value) {
}
----
