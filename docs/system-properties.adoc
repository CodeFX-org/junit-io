:page-description: JUnit Jupiter extensions to clear and set the values of system properties

The `@ClearSystemProperty` and `@SetSystemProperty` annotations can be used to clear, respectively, set the values of system properties for a test execution.
Both annotations work on the test method level and are repeatable as well as combinable.
After the annotated method has been executed, the initial default value is restored.

For example, clearing a system property for a test execution can be done as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Test
@ClearSystemProperty(key = "some property")
void test() {
    assertNull(System.getProperty("some property"));
}
----

And setting a system property for a test execution:

[source,java]
----
@Test
@SetSystemProperty(key = "some property", value = "new value")
void test() {
    assertEquals("new value", System.getProperty("some property"));
}
----

As mentioned before, both annotations are repeatable and they can also be combined:

----
@Test
@ClearSystemProperty(key = "1st property")
@ClearSystemProperty(key = "2nd property")
@SetSystemProperty(key = "3rd property", value = "new value")
void test() {
    assertNull(System.getProperty("1st property"));
    assertNull(System.getProperty("2nd property"));
    assertEquals("new value", System.getProperty("3rd property"));
}
----
