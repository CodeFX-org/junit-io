:page-title: Testing all test parameter combinations (Cartesian product)
:page-description: Extends JUnit Jupiter with `@CartesianProductTest`, a special `@ParameterizedTest` which tests all combinations of its input

Sometimes you want to test not only for specific inputs but also combinations of those inputs.
`@CartesianProductTest` combines all test inputs and runs a test for each combination.

[#_basic_use]
== Basic Use

`@CartesianProductTest` is used _instead_ of `@Test` or other such annotations (e.g. `@RepeatedTest`).
The annotation can have a value (see <<Supplying a value to CartesianProductTest>>), or the test class can have a static factory method (see <<Writing a static factory method for the parameters>>) providing the arguments.

== Supplying a value to CartesianProductTest

If all your test parameters are strings, you can supply all input parameters simultaneously by giving a value to `@CartesianProductTest`.
This value is the input for all parameters, and the test will try every combination it can have.

```java
@CartesianProductTest({"0", "1"})
void threeBits(String a, String b, String c) {
    int value = Integer.parseUnsignedInt(a + b + c, 2);
    Assertions.assertThat(value).isBetween(0b000, 0b111);
}
```

The test `threeBits` is executed exactly eight times, because all three input parameters can have the value "0" or "1".
`@CartesianProductTest` tests for all input combinations; that's `2 × 2 × 2`, so eight tests in total.

To demonstrate with a table:
|===
| # of test | value of `a` | value of `b` | value of `c`
| 1st test  | 0            | 0            | 0
| 2nd test  | 0            | 0            | 1
| 3rd test  | 0            | 1            | 0
| 4th test  | 0            | 1            | 1
| 5th test  | 1            | 0            | 0
| 6th test  | 1            | 0            | 1
| 7th test  | 1            | 1            | 0
| 8th test  | 1            | 1            | 1
|===

== Writing a static factory method for the parameters

`@CartesianProductTest` can have a static factory method supplying the test parameters.
By default, this method must have the same name as the test method, but you can specify a different name with the `factory()` annotation parameter.
[#_static-factory-example]
```java
@CartesianProductTest
void nFold(String string, Class<?> clazz, TimeUnit unit) {
    // passing test code
}

static CartesianProductTest.Sets nFold() {
    return new CartesianProductTest.Sets()
        .add("Alpha", "Omega")
        .add(Runnable.class, Cloneable.class, Predicate.class)
        .add(TimeUnit.DAYS, TimeUnit.HOURS);
}
```

The test `nFold` is executed exactly twelve times.
The first parameter can have any of the two values `"Alpha"` or `"Omega"`.
The second parameter can have any of the three values `Runnable.class`, `Cloneable.class` or `Predicate.class`.
The third parameter can have any of the two values `TimeUnit.DAYS` or `TimeUnit.HOURS`.
`@CartesianProductTest` tests for all input combinations; that's `2 × 3 × 2`, so twelve tests in total.
To demonstrate with a table:
|===
| # of test  | value of `string` | value of `clazz` | value of `unit`
| 1st test   | "Alpha"           | Runnable.class   | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 2nd test   | "Alpha"           | Runnable.class   | TimeUnit.HOURS
| 3rd test   | "Alpha"           | Cloneable.class  | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 4th test   | "Alpha"           | Cloneable.class  | TimeUnit.HOURS
| 5th test   | "Alpha"           | Predicate.class  | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 6th test   | "Alpha"           | Predicate.class  | TimeUnit.HOURS
| 7th test   | "Omega"           | Runnable.class   | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 8th test   | "Omega"           | Runnable.class   | TimeUnit.HOURS
| 9th test   | "Omega"           | Cloneable.class  | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 10th test  | "Omega"           | Cloneable.class  | TimeUnit.HOURS
| 11th test  | "Omega"           | Predicate.class  | TimeUnit.DAYS
| 12th test  | "Omega"           | Predicate.class  | TimeUnit.HOURS
|===

There are a couple conditions this method has to fulfill to qualify:

- must have the same name as the test method or its name must be specified via `factory()`
- must be `static`
- must have **no** parameters
- must return `CartesianProductTest.Sets` ^1^
- must register values for every parameter exactly once ^2^

1: This is a helper class, specifically for creating sets for `@CartesianProductTest`.
The way to use it: instantiate it (`new CartesianProductTest.Sets()`), then use the `add()` method to register values for the parameters (see <<_static-factory-example, above>>).

2: If you register too few, too many, or conflicting ^3^ parameters, you will get an `org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException`.

3: For example, if your test method has a `TestInfo` or `TestReporter` (or any other parameter that is automatically injected by JUnit) and you register too much sets in your factory method:
```java
@CartesianProductTest
void confusing(String a, TestInfo info) {
    // completely valid test
}

static CartesianProductTest.Sets confusing() {
    return new CartesianProductTest.Sets()
        .add("A", "B", "C")
        .add(1, 2, 3);
}
```

== Combining `@CartesianProductTest` with `@Test`

If `@CartesianProductTest` is combined with `@Test` or `TestTemplate`-based mechanisms (like `@RepeatedTest` or `@ParameterizedTest`), the test engine will execute it according to each annotation (i.e. more than once).
This is most likely unwanted and will probably lead to the following exception/failure message:

> org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ParameterResolutionException:
> No ParameterResolver registered for parameter [...]

This is because `@Test` does not know what to do with the parameter(s) of the `@CartesianProductTest`.

== Thread-Safety

This extension is safe to use during https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parallel-execution[parallel test execution].
